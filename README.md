# ChessEngine
A project I am currently working on that utilizes python to control engines such as Stockfish and Leela, and provide full game analysis with a GUI included.
You are free to fork, modify, or utilize this project for yourself if you would like to.

# Engine compatibility
This project is compatible with all engines that utilize the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) system.

# Instructions
* Launch the main file for the program.
* Once the interface has opened, select the engine you would like to use (see compatible engines above).
* Configure the settings for the engine. The primary details you want to focus on are:
   - taet
* You may now paste in the PGN for your game and it will be analysed utilizing your computer's hardware.

# Credits
I am responsible for coding the engine analysis and connection between the program and the User Interface.
The chess board display has been mostly copied from AlejoG10's [python-chess-ai-yt](https://github.com/AlejoG10/python-chess-ai-yt) project.
